WARNING: [Power 33-334] Simulation is not consistent with clock constraints on net clk. Please check the clocks defined using create_clock command and simulation clock used to generate the SAIF and make sure they are same.
WARNING: [Power 33-330] Read_saif is trying to annotate activities on clock net and this will be ignored. Users shall manually specify clock net frequency using sdc timing constraints(e.g. create_clock)

WARNING: [Timing 38-242] The property HD.CLK_SRC of clock port "clk" is not set. In out-of-context mode, this prevents timing estimation for clock delay/skew
Resolution: Set the HD.CLK_SRC property of the out-of-context port to the location of the clock buffer instance in the top-level design
