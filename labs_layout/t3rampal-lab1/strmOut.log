WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file './torus_xbar_1b.gds' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /CMC/tsmc_65nm/CRN65GP/TN65CMSP018K3_V1.0C/tsmcN65/tsmcN65.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

INFO (XSTRM-223): 1. Translating cellView tsmcN65/M1_PO/layout as STRUCTURE M1_PO_CDNS_733455389410.
INFO (XSTRM-223): 2. Translating cellView tsmcN65/nch/layout as STRUCTURE nch_CDNS_733455389410.
WARNING (XSTRM-315): The cellview 'tsmcN65/nch/layout' has a label with multiple lines. This label will be translated as is. If a multiple lines label is not required, correct the label in the source file.
WARNING (XSTRM-35): The objects in the layer-purpose pair 'instance:drawing' are ignored. This is because the layer-purpose pair used in the design is not specified in the layer map file. Specify the layer-purpose pair in the layer map file and try again.
INFO (XSTRM-223): 3. Translating cellView tsmcN65/nch/layout as STRUCTURE nch_CDNS_733455389411.
WARNING (XSTRM-315): The cellview 'tsmcN65/nch/layout' has a label with multiple lines. This label will be translated as is. If a multiple lines label is not required, correct the label in the source file.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the objectMap option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the objectMap option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream. For details on the objectMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
